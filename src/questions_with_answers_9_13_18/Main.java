Exercise 9
12.345 and 3456.091 can be referred to float data type.
34.567839023 and 8923.1234857 can be referred to double data types.

Exercise 13
int year = 201l;
System.out.print (year);
The code will not compile, because we could have lost some information if it had been converted from long to int.


Exercise 18

long max = 3123456789L;        (added L)
double d = 1000_00;            (removed .)
char i =’i’; char j=’j’; char ij = (char)(i +j);
int a7 = 8;                    (variable name should not start with a number)
long h = 0; h = h  + 8;        (at fist we should initialize the variable)
int n, m = 11; n = m;          (because m was initialized and n had not any value)
